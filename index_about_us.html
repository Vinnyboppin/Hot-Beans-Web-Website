	<u><h2>About Hot Beans Web</h2></u>
	<br>
	<p>We are Hot Beans and we are a web development team that branches out internationally. We are a web development company and we plan to hire more
		ambitious website developers. In order to do this we aim to find workers who are willing to cooperate with our existing web developers and communicate efficiently. We provide the best branding, graphic designs, strategies, and deliveries helping many other companies with their websites such as Heinz Baked Beins, Grumpy Mule and CauCawa in spreading their brand awareness which we are able to do through the hiring of various web developers that can not only code but graphic design as well. Along the way our brand has grown significantly larger which allowed us to aid the companies that were mentioned previously before. For the future of Hot Beans Web we aim to hire more people to web develop so that we can help many other well known brands in setting up websites
